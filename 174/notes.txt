Q1:
-nothing to learn here

Q2:
during contest:
-I used dict to count instances of each number (C)
-took values and made sorted array (C)
-tried to do sliding window ranging from 1-(n-1) to find consecutive length or something ??? (W)
notes:
-should have just started counting from the end of the array to find min # removals

Q3:
during contest:
-correct logic but time limit exceeded
-I had func to find sum of nodes at any point (C)
-did dfs finding max between current above * bottom, left child, right child (C)
-every function call I recalculated above (added left or right of parent) (W) * way too slow
notes:
-sum of above and below always = total
-should have calculated total once as global var
-at every increment I should have calculated below and multiplied (sum-below)*below
-had global var for ans (starting at -inf) and dfs looking for ans
