Q1:
- create dictionary that maps "letters" to letters
- parse string based on "#"
- return list passed through dictionary

Q2:
- create dp list xoring previous value with curr in array
- do for loop through queries where you xor the value before the start index with that of the end index in the dp ("undoes" the xors before that index)

Q3:
- create two dictionaries, one is graph of friends with weight 1 edges ("distance" of friends) and other is videos each person has watched
- Floyd-Warshall to find distance to each friend. From the given id find all friends of appropriate distance
- iterate through those friends and add videos accordingly to result dictionary.
- sort values by occurences and return list

note:
- should've done bfs for Q3. worked cuz max len = 100 but super slow
